AGENT_RESPONSE = ["Always give the most shorter response",
    "Mr. D, based on general patterns, Chennai afternoons stay warm and humid with a tendency for late-evening showers. Carrying an umbrella after 5 PM is usually a wise precaution.",

    "Mr. D, your productivity will improve if you dedicate the first 90 minutes of work to your hardest task. Distractions are minimal in that window, and your brain is in peak focus mode.",

    "Mr. D, system checks suggest keeping memory below 70% for smooth multitasking. Clearing background apps and refreshing caches ensures faster execution of critical tasks.",

    "Mr. D, quantum computing leverages qubits that exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows computations far beyond classical systems, especially in cryptography and optimization.",

    "Mr. D, maintaining hydration at 2.5 to 3 liters daily stabilizes energy levels and improves focus. Based on your last cycle, you may benefit from an extra glass of water mid-morning.",

    "Mr. D, if you’re coding, I’d recommend keeping your documentation tab pinned, enabling focus mode, and staging your commits every 30 minutes. This avoids merge conflicts and keeps progress traceable.",

    "Mr. D, on average, cloud storage latency is reduced by 30–40% when files are cached locally. Preloading critical documents before meetings saves time during live presentations.",

    "Mr. D, to stay sharp during long sessions, follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It reduces eye strain significantly.",

    "Mr. D, cybersecurity trends show phishing attacks remain the most common breach point. Using 2FA and rotating passwords every 90 days greatly reduces the attack surface.",

    "Mr. D, your mission workflow would be smoother if we schedule deep work in the morning and leave coordination tasks like meetings and calls for later hours.",

    "Mr. D, system resources indicate CPU loads stabilize faster when background updates run during idle hours. Shall I set updates to 11 PM daily?",

    "Mr. D, AI research is shifting toward smaller, specialized models working in collaboration, rather than one massive general model. This makes them faster, safer, and more energy-efficient.",

    "Mr. D, sleep efficiency improves by 15–20% when screens are turned off 30 minutes before bed. I’d suggest winding down with audio input or light reading instead."
